## USER GUIDE

### Key concepts for Cisco Networks

The Splunk Admin must know how to configure data inputs and how Splunk stores and searches data in different indexes and how roles apply to what indexes are searched. 


### Data types

This app provides search-time knowledge for the following types of data from Cisco IOS variants, NX-OS and WLC:

**Search-time**

- cisco:ios - Syslog events from your devices
- Cisco:SmartCallHome - Inventory data from your devices


These data types support the following Common Information Model data models:


| Source Type | CIM Data Models |
| --- | --- |
| cisco:ios | Change Analysis<br/>Authentication<br/>Network Traffic<br/>|
| Cisco:SmartCallHome | Inventory|

### Lookups

The Cisco Networks app contains 3 lookup files.

**cisco_ios_facility_categories.csv**

Provides the vendor's description of an event category based on the event's facility.

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_facility_categories.csv
- Lookup fields: facility, vendor_category
- Lookup contents: See the file contents

**cisco_ios_messages.csv**

Provides the vendor's recommended actions, explanations and message texts based on the event's facility, severity_id and mnemonic,

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_messages.csv
- Lookup fields: facility, severity_id, mnemonic, vendor_message_text, vendor_explanation, vendor_recommended_action
- Lookup contents: See the file contents

**cisco_ios_variable_representations.csv**

Not yet in use, but may be used to look up the variables from vendor_message_text to get a friendly explanation of the type of variable

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_variable_representations.csv
- Lookup fields: vendor_variable_field, vendor_variable_type_of_information
- Lookup contents: See the file contents
